  summary:
    "I'm a curious builder who loves breaking things, reconfiguring systems, and solving edge cases. I thrive on challenges and enjoy creating high-availability architectures, automating workflows, and debugging at scale. Outside of code, I'm passionate about hacking, pentesting, astrophotography, 3D printing, and crafting custom keyboards and cyberdecks. Right now, I'm in the zone—learning new technologies and experimenting as I go. Currently, I'm deep into building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application and loving every bit of the chaos.",
